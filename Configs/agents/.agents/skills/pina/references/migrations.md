# Migrations

Migration is opt-in and program-owned. Accounts are migrated to the current representation inside the transaction that touches them, and the payload of an instruction that opts in with `migrations` is normalized before its handler runs. Instructions covered only by `auto` are snapshots without a version byte, and events are versioned, never converted. Clients never migrate and never pass a version. Use this file as the operational checklist; `docs/src/migrations/flow.md` in the Pina repository carries the full runtime decision tree.

## Envelope

Every enveloped contract writes:

```text
[discriminator][schema version][payload]
```

| Kind                             | Envelope                        | History                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account (`migrations` or `auto`) | yes                             | every version, adjacent transitions                     |
| Instruction under `auto` only    | no — `[discriminator][payload]` | one snapshot, `"envelope": false`, no transitions       |
| Instruction with `migrations`    | yes                             | every version, adjacent transitions                     |
| Event (`migrations` or `auto`)   | yes                             | every version, each with its own schema, no transitions |

- The version sits immediately after the discriminator, is little-endian, and is never written by application source. Macros inject it from `migrations/manifest.json`.
- Version `0` is the first captured shape. `pina migrations create` allocates later versions; source code never declares a number.
- Versions are counted per contract, not per program: every account, instruction, and event owns an independent history that starts at `0`, so a program can hold one contract at version `3` and another at `0`.
- The width is program-wide and recorded only as `versionType` in `migrations/manifest.json`: `u8` (the default and the recommendation), `u16`, or `u32`. Set it with `pina migrations create --version-type <WIDTH>`; a run without the flag keeps the recorded width. `u64` is rejected; discriminator width is a separate setting that does support `u64`.
- Prefer `u8`: 255 versions of one contract is not a realistic ceiling, and it is the cheapest envelope. Choose a wider width before the first release only when one contract is expected to exceed 255 versions.
- While nothing is published (no receipt and no pending record), `--version-type` rewrites the width in place. The first persistent publication freezes it: after that the flag fails with "Migration version encoding is frozen as u8 because a deployment published it, so it cannot become u16", because changing it would break every migration-aware contract.

## Opt in

Per contract, add the `migrations` token to the schema attribute:

```rust
#[account(discriminator = AccountType::Profile, migrations)]
#[instruction(discriminator = Instruction::Update, migrations)]
#[event(discriminator = EventKind::Changed, migrations)]
```

`migrations = true` is equivalent. `migrations = false` opts one contract out.

`#[discriminator(entrypoint)]` wires the reserved `Migrate` route on its own. The slot ladder is derived from `migrations/manifest.json` (one slot per enveloped account contract, in identity-sorted order, matching generated clients); an explicit `migrations(A, B)` list is an optional override for batching several accounts of one contract in a single sweep:

```rust
#[discriminator(entrypoint)]
pub enum ProgramInstruction {
	// …
}

// Optional ceiling, plus the same-contract batching override.
#[discriminator(entrypoint, migrations(State, State), migrations_max_lamports = 20_000)]
```

The route calls the resize executor, so the program needs `pina`'s `account-resize` feature; `pina init` scaffolds it, and the generated code names it when missing. `migrations_max_lamports` is optional: declaring one caps the reserved instruction's total rent transfers, while omitting it enforces no ceiling — safe because a transfer never exceeds the rent deficit of a growth the runtime caps at `MAX_PERMITTED_DATA_INCREASE`.

Exactly one discriminator enum per program may carry `entrypoint`; `pina build` fails closed when two declare it.

Whole kinds, through the `--auto` flag of `pina migrations create`:

```sh
pina migrations create --auto true   # every kind; or --auto accounts,events,instructions, or --auto false
```

- `--auto` accepts `true` (or `all`), `false` (or `none`), or a comma-separated list of exactly `accounts`, `events`, and `instructions`. Unknown names and duplicates are rejected. A run without the flag keeps the recorded policy; with no manifest yet, it records none.
- The policy lives only in `migrations/manifest.json`. `pina.toml` holds no copy: the retired `[migrations].auto` and `[migrations].version_type` (or `version-type`) keys fail every command that reads `pina.toml` with "`[migrations].auto` no longer belongs in pina.toml: … run `pina migrations create --auto true` to record it". Remove the key and run the command the error names; do not move the setting anywhere else.
- `auto` envelopes accounts and events. It records instructions as snapshots without an envelope, so covering them changes no payload byte; opt one instruction into the envelope with `#[instruction(discriminator = X, migrations)]`. Events are versioned, never converted: the program emits only the current version.
- `pina migrations create` records the policy as `auto` in `migrations/manifest.json` and snapshots every contract of the listed kinds. Macros read the recorded policy, so a declaration covered by `auto` still fails the build with the `pina migrations create` remedy until it has a snapshot.
- When a policy is recorded, `create` scaffolds a `build.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=migrations/manifest.json");
}
```

Scaffolding is idempotent and never overwrites a hand-written build script; `create` prints the exact line to add instead, and `pina migrations check` fails until the directive is present. The directive exists because proc macros do not re-expand when the manifest changes, so a policy flip must trigger expansion from the manifest alone.

- Enabling `auto` on an already-launched program inserts an envelope into every listed account and event. `create` records one history entry per newly enveloped contract and the change is a deliberate wire-format change; on a new program it is simply the version-zero baseline.
- `migrations = false` cannot remove an envelope the manifest already records, and dropping an enveloped kind with `--auto` is rejected the same way. Neither can a hand edit of the manifest's `auto`: a declaration without a `migrations` token that the recorded policy no longer covers, but that the manifest records with an envelope, fails the build. Stripping an envelope is a wire-format change that must be recorded deliberately.

### Instructions without an envelope

An instruction covered by `auto` without the `migrations` token keeps `[discriminator][payload]` and is recorded with exactly one version and `"envelope": false`.

- The `#[instruction]` macro fails the build when the struct drifts from the snapshot. While nothing is published, `create` replaces the snapshot.
- After publication a payload change fails with `PublishedPayloadChanged`: declare a new discriminator, or restore the published fields. Do not add `migrations` to get past it — a published snapshot cannot gain an envelope (`EnvelopeAddition`), because every existing client sends no version byte.
- Appending optional accounts to a published instruction (snapshot or enveloped) extends its recorded process in place; no version is consumed. `create` prints `Appended optional accounts to <contract>@<version>`.
- An instruction that stops asking to be recorded (`migrations = false`, or `auto` no longer covering instructions) fails `check` with `StaleSnapshot`; `create` releases the snapshot and nothing on the wire changes.
- `#[instruction(discriminator = X, migrations)]` opts in to the envelope and adjacent transitions under `migrations/transitions/instruction_<width>_<hex>/`. Removing the token before publication and re-running `create` turns it back into a snapshot. After publication the removal fails with `EnvelopeRemoval`, and the macro fails first with "removing an envelope is a wire-format change that `pina migrations create` must record deliberately".
- A manifest written at ABI `0.20` recorded every instruction with an envelope. After upgrading, add `migrations` to each published instruction to keep its wire format; the build error names the contract.

## The loop

Run from the program directory:

```sh
pina migrations create    # snapshot source changes and generate adjacent transitions
pina migrations check     # non-mutating build/CI gate; the same drift checks `pina build` enforces
pina migrations status    # version + publication state per contract, plus a cost preview
pina migrations sync      # create -> build -> generate for unambiguous changes
```

- `create` writes `migrations/manifest.json`, `migrations/publications.json`, and `migrations/transitions/<contract>/vN_to_vM.rs`, then prints any manual transition paths and growth warnings. It replaces an unpublished draft in place; once the version appears in a publication receipt or a pending deployment it appends the next version instead.
- `create` also generates and regenerates `tests/abi_layout.rs`, a committed file carrying one module per contract with its `SCHEMA_SHA256`, sizes, offsets, and field list. It holds constants, not `#[test]` functions, so `cargo test` passing says nothing about it; its force is that `check` fails with "the generated ABI layout test … is stale" whenever the file no longer matches the manifest, which makes it a second drift gate rather than a convenience. Compact modules report `MIN_SIZE` and `MAX_SIZE` including the envelope header and `HEADER_SIZE` excluding it. Never hand-edit it; regenerate with `create`. A change that alters a contract's _physical_ layout — including widening a compact capacity, which moves `MAX_SIZE` but leaves the active bytes alone — makes it stale even when the transition body itself is a no-op.
- `check` fails on source drift, a missing snapshot, an unfinished or hash-changed transition, a changed published schema, a stale or missing `tests/abi_layout.rs`, or a missing build-script rerun directive. Drift compares what a field stores, not its spelling: `PodU64` and `u64`, `Address` and `[u8; 32]`, `PodString<N>` and `String<N>`, and `PodVec<T, N>` and `Vec<T, N>` are one schema, so respelling a type consumes no version and fails no build, and the recorded spelling stays. `check --json` stays a status-only array.
- `status` runs the same drift checks as `check`, prints `kind name vN (draft|published|publication pending, N version(s) remaining)` — or `kind name (<state>, snapshot without envelope)` for a snapshot-only instruction — and ends with the cost preview below. Its JSON carries `envelope` per contract. `status --json` keeps the status array unchanged under `statuses` and adds a `costPreview` object.
- `pina migrations inspect <ADDRESS> [--url <RPC>] [--json]` reads one on-chain account and reports its stored version against the manifest plus the pending adjacent hops with byte sizes and approximate rent delta. It exits non-zero when the account is stale or from the future.
- `pina migrations reconcile [--abandon]` resolves an ambiguous pending deployment. Do not start a different deployment while one is pending. `pina deploy` discards its own pending record only when the deploy program provably never started (for example `solana` is not installed), so an install-and-rerun needs no `--abandon`; any deploy command that started and failed keeps the record, because it may have reached the cluster.
- Every receipt in `migrations/publications.json` pins every version it made live: each contract maps to a list whose entry `n` holds version `n`'s `schemaSha256` (and `transitionSha256` when a transition enters it). A receipt records only `rpcUrl`, `executableSha256`, `versions`, and `abandoned`; the program is the manifest's `programId`, and there is no hash chain, because version control keeps the file append-only. An empty list fails every command with "pins no versions"; restore the file from version control, and never blank a pin list to get past a check.
- `pina migrations reconcile --pin-legacy` repairs only an ABI `0.20` ledger, the one format that could name a published version without pinning it. Reading such a ledger fails with an error naming the command. Confirm from version control that `migrations/manifest.json` still records exactly what those receipts shipped, then run it once: it pins each entry from the manifest and writes the ledger in the current shape. On a `0.21` ledger it reports nothing to pin.
- `sync` runs `create`, then `pina build`, then `pina generate`, so it needs the Agave `cargo-build-sbf` and a `bpf-entrypoint` feature. It can fail after `create` has already rewritten files; review the diff before re-running.
- `pina test --compatibility` consumes the checked-in historical fixtures. Commit the manifest, publication ledger, and transition files; never generate them during a build.

Ambiguous renames (a field disappears while a same-typed field appears) fail with the exact flags:

```sh
pina migrations create --rename value:points    # preserve the stored bytes
pina migrations create --assume-removed value   # discard them; the new field starts zeroed
pina migrations create --manual value           # write the conversion by hand
```

`--manual <field>` names an **added** field and makes the transition manual, which is how a conversion such as merging two fields into one is written: pair it with `--rename`/`--assume-removed` to say which stored fields feed the new value, then complete the generated stub. It also legalizes a rename whose type changed, which a generated byte copy cannot express. Passing it for a draft that `create` already recorded as automatic converts that draft: the automatic file is replaced with a manual stub. The answer is recorded in the manifest's transition, so repeated `create` runs keep the manual draft instead of regenerating an automatic transition over your body.

`[migrations.answers]` in `pina.toml` (`rename = ["value:points"]`, `assume_removed = []`, `manual = ["value"]`) is where you record answers you want fresh clones and CI to replay. `create` reads that table but never writes it, so copy a flag there yourself when CI must repeat the decision; a flag that contradicts a recorded answer fails closed. With `--json`, `--no-interactive`, or no terminal, an unanswered question is a hard failure: `{"error": "...", "questions": [{"contract", "from", "to", "rust_type"}]}` prints on stdout (a removal has `"to": ""`), the human-readable error on stderr, exit status 1.

### First-time envelopes need an acknowledgement

`create` fails closed with `EnvelopeAcknowledgementRequired` when it is about to insert a version envelope into a contract that is already published, because that is a wire-format change existing on-chain accounts cannot have. It lists the affected contracts and refuses until you pass `--envelope-ack` to state that you meant it:

```sh
pina migrations create --envelope-ack
```

Pass it when the change is deliberate — a brand-new contract of a published kind, or a contract whose discriminator changed, also trips this even though nothing live shifts, since the recorded policy did not previously envelope it — and stop when you did not expect it, because the usual cause is a contract you did not mean to opt in. The flag never appears in a plain `create` run, so seeing it named is itself information: something just gained an envelope. A snapshot-only instruction adds no byte, so it never trips this guard.

The same guard covers removing an envelope. `migrations = false` on a contract the manifest records with an envelope, or dropping a kind from `auto`, fails with `EnvelopeRemoval` and has no override flag: stripping an envelope is a wire-format break you must record deliberately rather than silence.

## Cost preview

`pina migrations status` ends with a static planning estimate, never a quote. It derives from the checked-in manifest and, when present, `pina profile`'s per-symbol estimates of the compiled SBF artifact, and it prints the two models alongside the figures so they stay interpretable:

- Per account contract: current size (compact schemas quote their declared capacity), the bytes a version-0 day-one account grows, and that growth's rent deficit at the same ~6,960 lamports per grown byte the `create` warning uses.
- Per instruction process: the worst-case ladder a stale account it names can trigger — the oldest version within `MAX_INLINE_STEPS` (8) of current, one adjacent transition per step — with its step count, rent, and static CU estimate. A history with more than eight transitions quotes a ladder that starts partway up and adds a note that a day-one account instead fails with `MigrationUnavailable`; the day-one growth figure still counts every pending byte.
- Program-wide: the touching transaction funding the most rent (size `max_lamports` from it) and, independently, the instruction with the longest worst-case ladder (size `MAX_INLINE_STEPS` from it). They need not be the same instruction, and each names its own.

The static CU figure sums `pina profile`'s estimates of the generated `vN_to_vM` `migrate` functions and excludes executor overhead (resize, rent transfer, validation) and runtime branch or loop effects. It is never a misleading zero: a missing or unprofilable artifact, or a transition symbol without an estimate, prints `CU unavailable: <reason>` instead. A figure that cannot be estimated serializes as `{ "status": "unavailable", "reason": "..." }`.

Instruction processes link to account contracts by account-slot name, and only a writable, non-signer slot can hold an account the executor migrates. A writable, non-signer slot that names no checked-in account contract produces an explicit note — the symptom of a renamed account or a slot typo; signer and read-only slots are skipped without noise. A note also flags any single step whose growth exceeds `MAX_PERMITTED_DATA_INCREASE` (10,240 bytes).

## Source of truth: the manifest

- `migrations/manifest.json` is the only home of the migration policy (`auto`) and the version width (`versionType`), and the only policy source procedural macros consult. It is checked in, which keeps builds deterministic and reproducible.
- An undecodable or stale manifest fails macro expansion with the `pina migrations create` remedy, and so does a missing one for a contract that carries an explicit `migrations` token.
- Without a manifest there is no policy anywhere: contracts without a `migrations` token compile, and `pina build`, `pina idl`, and `pina generate` run, with no envelope. A `pina init` project starts there, so run `pina keys new` and then `pina migrations create --auto true` before generating clients anyone keeps. Never delete `migrations/` to clear an error: the policy and width go with it.
- Do not hand-edit the manifest, the publication ledger, or generated transition files. If `migrations/publications.json` is lost while the manifest records advanced versions, every later check fails because published history must stay pinned; restore the ledger from version control.
- The manifest records the program ID. While nothing was ever deployed (no receipt and no pending record), `pina migrations create` rebinds the history to a new `declare_id!`, which is the normal path after `pina keys new`; `pina keys` prints that hint. Once anything is published the history belongs to that program, and every command fails with `ProgramIdentityChanged` until the original `declare_id!` is restored.
- Removing a contract from source fails with `ContractRemoved`, even while it is only a draft. On a program that has never been deployed, every version is a version-0 draft, so deleting `migrations/` and re-running `create` with the same `--auto` and `--version-type` values re-baselines losslessly; after publication, retire it with a successor contract instead.
- The document version is the string `abiVersion` (currently `"0.21"`), a sibling of the on-chain versions and independent of them: an ABI document upgrade never consumes an on-chain migration version. The older integer `formatVersion` counters are retired, and a document written before `abiVersion` existed fails to decode rather than upgrading itself. The same string appears in `migrations/manifest.json` and `migrations/publications.json`.
- The contract key `kind:width:hex` (for example `account:1:01`) is the identity, and the wire codec is implied by `abiVersion`; a `0.21` manifest stores neither an `identity` object nor a `codec`, omits `transition` on a version that has none, and writes a process slot's `writable`, `signer`, and `optional` only when true and its `defaultValue` and `pda` only when set. A `0.20` document is converted in memory, and the next `create` writes it in the new shape. Leftover `migrations/transitions/event_*` directories are no longer read; delete them.
- A document whose `abiVersion` is newer than the running build fails closed. Regenerate the documents with the matching CLI instead of editing the field.

## Generated vs manual transitions

`create` generates automatic transitions for direction-safe fixed-layout changes: exact field copies, insertions and removals that shift later fields, and zero-fill for unambiguous account additions, plus the generated size constants and length guard. An instruction argument is never zero-filled — the handler could not tell that default from a value the client sent — so an instruction transition that adds an argument is always manual. Byte offsets and `SOURCE_SIZE` always come from the **stored** schema, so a field removed from the middle of a layout leaves the fields after it readable at their original offsets. Type changes (including widening such as `u64` to `u128`, and a change between types that only share a width, such as `u64` to `i64`; a respelling that stores the same bytes is not a type change), reordering existing fields, compact layouts, ambiguous moves, and a `--manual` answer produce a manual file containing `TODO(pina-manual-migration)`. Replace the body.

A finished manual body is valid only for the two layouts it converts between. While its draft's destination schema stays unchanged (for example only an account slot changes), `create` keeps the body. When you change the draft's layout again, `create` moves the finished body to `vN_to_vM.rs.stale`, writes a fresh stub for the new offsets, and prints the move. The stub's `TODO` blocks the build until you port the old body to the new offsets; delete the `.stale` file once you have. Never copy the old body back unchanged: it compiles against the new layout and misplaces bytes without any error.

### The transition ABI

Every transition, automatic or manual, exposes the same size constants and a `migrate` entry point. Read the generated header before writing a body; you should never need to consult the CLI's source to learn the offsets.

An **automatic** transition also carries the version pair:

```rust
pub(crate) const FROM_VERSION: u32 = 0;
pub(crate) const TO_VERSION: u32 = 1;
pub(crate) const SOURCE_SIZE: usize = 42;
pub(crate) const DESTINATION_SIZE: usize = 50;
pub(crate) const WORKING_SIZE: usize = 50;

pub(crate) fn migrate(data: &mut [u8]) {
	if data.len() < WORKING_SIZE {
		return;
	}
	// Byte moves first, then zero fills for anything new.
}
```

A **manual** transition drops `FROM_VERSION`/`TO_VERSION` — the directory and file name already encode the pair — and keeps the three sizes plus a stub body to replace:

```rust
pub(crate) const SOURCE_SIZE: usize = 42;
pub(crate) const DESTINATION_SIZE: usize = 42;
pub(crate) const WORKING_SIZE: usize = 42;

pub(crate) fn migrate(data: &mut [u8]) {
	if data.len() < WORKING_SIZE {
		return;
	}
	let _ = data;
}
```

- `data` is the **whole account or instruction payload, including the discriminator and the version envelope**. A manual file's generated comment block prints each field's offsets "relative to the version envelope header", so add the header length to index into `data`. The header is the discriminator width plus the version width (`MIGRATION_HEADER_SIZE` in the generated `tests/abi_layout.rs`; 2 bytes for a `u8` discriminator with a `u8` version). A `count: u64` printed at `32..40` therefore lives at `data[34..42]`.
- `SOURCE_SIZE` and `DESTINATION_SIZE` include the header and are the stored and target _total_ sizes, so a manual body can check what it wrote against `DESTINATION_SIZE`.
- `WORKING_SIZE` is the scratch the executor provides, at least as large as both other sizes and never above `MAX_MIGRATION_WORKSPACE` (1,024 bytes). Keep the generated length guard: a body that runs on a short slice reads past the end.
- Read source bytes at their **stored** offsets and write destination bytes at their **destination** offsets. When a field moves, copy it before overwriting the region it came from; generated automatic transitions order their `copy_within` calls for exactly that reason, so preserve the ordering they establish.

- A manual account `migrate` returns `()` and must be total for the accepted source: it must fully initialize every active destination byte. It cannot reject once funding or resizing may have happened — a failure there aborts the instruction instead of returning a catchable error. Validate rejectable value constraints in `target_size`/`working_size`, which run before any mutation.
- A manual instruction `migrate` returns `bool` (`false` rejects) and runs in scratch space, so it may reject invalid semantic values before dispatch. Events have no transitions.

A **compact** contract replaces the plain fixed stub with a three-function shape, because its destination length depends on the stored values rather than the schema alone:

```rust
pub(crate) fn target_size(data: &[u8]) -> Option<usize> {
	let _ = data;
	None
}

pub(crate) fn working_size(data: &[u8], target_size: usize) -> Option<usize> {
	Some(data.len().max(target_size))
}

pub(crate) fn migrate(data: &mut [u8]) {
	let _ = data;
}
```

- `target_size` inspects the already-validated **historical** bytes and returns the destination allocation they should occupy, or `None` when they cannot be represented. It must not mutate the account: it runs during planning, before funding or resizing, so it is the only place a rejectable constraint can be enforced without stranding a half-migrated account. Return the exact size the migrated representation will occupy — for a compact tail, compute it from the decoded values rather than returning the maximum capacity, or every stale account is allocated at worst case.
- `working_size` sizes the scratch the body needs given that destination; the generated `Some(data.len().max(target_size))` is usually right.
- The generated comment block labels compact tail fields with their prefix, for example `label - 40..41 (string prefix, capacity 8)`, so the destination offsets you write are the header and prefix, not the full capacity.

An unfinished `TODO`, or a transition that no longer matches its recorded SHA-256, blocks macro expansion until the body is filled and `create` re-runs to record the hash. Published transition code and its schemas are immutable; fix a defect with a new version.

## Runtime behavior

- The current-version hot path is one envelope comparison with a generated constant; no history scan.
- A stale account fails the current-only loaders (`as_account`, `as_account_mut`, generated `try_from_bytes`) with `MigrationRequired`. The instruction that touches it migrates it explicitly, or a client prepends the reserved `Migrate` instruction:

```rust
MigrateAccount {
	account,
	payer: Some(&payer),
	program_id: &ID,
	max_lamports: MAX_INLINE_MIGRATION_LAMPORTS,
}
.invoke::<State>()?;
```

Each account climbs its own ladder one adjacent step at a time: plan from the exact historical layout without retaining borrows, fund the rent deficit, resize, apply, validate the destination, then commit the version last. Accounts in one instruction migrate independently. A failure after the first mutation aborts the instruction so Solana rolls back every resize, transfer, and byte write. The payer is the instruction's declared migration payer, a signer or a program PDA signing through `invoke_signed`; growth transfers only the deficit, capped by `max_lamports`, and never refunds. A client generated before the instruction gained its optional migration payer cannot fund growth, and its transaction fails with `MigrationRequired`.

- `#[discriminator(entrypoint)]` routes every instruction the manifest records with an envelope through its generated `process_versioned`: the workspace is cleared, each adjacent step runs and validates, the current version marker is committed last, and then `ProcessAccountInfos::process_from_version(self, data, source_version)` runs. Its default forwards to `process(data)`, so a handler reads `data` as the current layout and never normalizes it itself; override `process_from_version` only to tell a converted field from one the client sent. A hand-written dispatcher calls `<Instruction>::process_versioned(parsed_accounts, data)`, and `pina::normalize_instruction_data` returns a `NormalizedInstruction` (`as_bytes()`, `source_version()`, `was_migrated()`). Unknown and future versions are rejected without trial decoding.
- Events are never rewritten or converted. The program emits only the current version; a changed event appends a version with its own schema and no transition file. Generated clients decode each earlier version as its own `<Event>V<n>` event. Keep golden log bytes in `pina_test::HistoricalEvent` and decode them with the generated event for their version.
- The instruction process contract stays compatible only when existing account slots form an identical prefix on the wire (same name, signer, writable, and optional flags, in the same order) and every new slot is appended at the end and optional. Any other change (reorder, insertion, removal, rename, signer/writable/optional change, new required account) needs a new instruction discriminator. A slot's `defaultValue` and `pda` are client hints, never compared: a hint-only change is not drift and the recorded snapshot keeps its hints until a wire change replaces it.
- A rolled-back binary does not roll back accounts. Accounts written at version N are future versions for a binary whose current is N-1 and are rejected; rollback means redeploying an executable built from the current ABI history.

### Fund growth before you need it

`create` prints a growth warning for every transition that increases an account's size, quoting the rent a stale account will need — roughly 6,960 lamports per grown byte, charged to the instruction's migration payer. Size the program's budget constant for the **whole ladder a stale account will climb**, not one step, because the executor checks the cumulative deficit before each step mutates, so a budget that covers only the first step fails the second after the first has landed in memory:

```rust
/// Covers the full v0 → v3 ladder, not one step.
const MAX_INLINE_MIGRATION_LAMPORTS: u64 = 60_000;
```

Adding a single `u64` field to a 42-byte account grows it 8 bytes and quotes about 55,680 lamports, so a budget written for an earlier, smaller change is the common way a correct-looking migration fails in the field. When the answer is not obvious, `pina migrations status` prints the worst-case ladder per instruction with its step count and total rent; use that figure rather than adding a step's worth of headroom by habit.

## Read-only accounts

Migration asserts writability and program ownership, so a stale account an instruction only reads cannot be migrated there. Write one sweep instruction whose migratable accounts are optional writable views, plus a payer and the system program, and call `MigrateAccount::invoke::<T>()` per present account; then send `[sweep(...), real_instruction(...)]` in one transaction, sweep first, because the real instruction's load fails with `MigrationRequired` if it runs against stale bytes. The reserved `Migrate` instruction is the framework-owned instance of this pattern and generated clients compose it.

See the repository's sweep documentation for the full pattern: https://github.com/pina-rs/pina/blob/main/docs/src/migrations/flow.md#the-sweep-instruction

If a writable touch genuinely cannot be scheduled, generated accounts expose a read-only alternative: `Account::try_from_bytes_versioned(bytes)` returns an `AccountVersioned` enum with one variant per historical version plus `Current`. It never mutates, resizes, or requires a writable borrow, and fails closed on foreign discriminators, unknown or future versions, and malformed representations. The caller must handle every stored representation, so prefer migrating whenever a writable touch is schedulable.

## Budget failures

| `MigrationUnavailable`           | A stale account is further behind than the generated `MAX_INLINE_STEPS` (at most 8 adjacent transitions), the plan is not exactly the next adjacent step, or a reserved-instruction slot index is past the 63-slot bitmask. | Rebalance the history into more frequent, smaller versions and migrate accounts before they fall further behind. The reserved `Migrate` route is the out-of-band path but enforces the same step cap.                 |
| `MigrationWorkspaceExceeded`     | A generated transition's `WORKING_SIZE` is below its `CURRENT_SIZE`, or a caller-supplied workspace is shorter than `WORKING_SIZE`.                                                                                         | Give the workspace at least `WORKING_SIZE` bytes. The generated `with_current_instruction_data` helper already sizes it at the compile-time maximum, which stays at or below `MAX_MIGRATION_WORKSPACE` (1,024 bytes). |
| `MigrationAccountGrowthExceeded` | One step would grow the account past the runtime reallocation limit, `MAX_PERMITTED_DATA_INCREASE` (10,240 bytes), over the account's size at instruction start.                                                            | Publish intermediate versions so the change grows across separate transactions; no lamport budget raises this limit.                                                                                                  |
| `MigrationLamportBudgetExceeded` | The cumulative rent deficit of the planned steps exceeds the `max_lamports` the program passes to `MigrateAccount` or `MigrateContext`.                                                                                     | Raise the program's `max_lamports` constant (for example `MAX_INLINE_MIGRATION_LAMPORTS`) to cover the quoted deficit. `create` prints the estimated deficit for each growing transition.                             |

Also expect `MigrationRequired` (a stale account was touched without a migration path) and `InvalidMigrationVersion` (the stored version is unknown or newer than the program).

Builds before the split reported the workspace, growth, and lamport failures as the aggregate `MigrationBudgetExceeded` (`0xFFFF_FFF5`). That code stays reserved so published binaries remain decodable; clients must decode the aggregate code and the three split codes.

## Version exhaustion

Versions are counted per contract, not per program: each account, instruction, and event owns an independent history starting at `0`, so a `u8` program gives every contract its own 255-version budget. A snapshot-only instruction never consumes a version. `pina migrations status` prints what is left (`account State v3 (published, 252 version(s) remaining)`), and `status --json`/`check --json` carry it as `versionsRemaining`.

The width is program-wide and freezes at the first persistent publication, so it cannot be widened after release. Pre-launch, widen it with `pina migrations create --version-type u16` (or `u32`): with no receipt and no pending record, every history is still a single draft, so the manifest simply records the new width; rebuild and regenerate clients afterwards so they write the wider field. Do not delete `migrations/` or edit `versionType` by hand.

Reaching the ceiling is terminal for that contract. `create` fails closed with `VersionExhausted` and the on-chain path rejects out-of-range versions instead of truncating, so no version number is ever reused. The remedy is a successor contract: a new discriminator with a fresh version-0 history, plus a bridge instruction that reads the exhausted account through the current loaders and writes the successor, with clients sweeping accounts lazily. History cannot be pruned, because a program cannot enumerate its own accounts.

## Honest limits

- Data written before the envelope existed is not interpreted as version zero: its first payload bytes could be a valid version by accident. Adopting migrations on a live program is a deliberate wire-format change that needs a new discriminator or a bridge. ADR 0008 tracks the unbuilt `legacy` ergonomics, so do not promise a launched program a transparent adoption.
- Shrinking never refunds lamports, and surplus bytes stay in the account.
- Generated `needsMigration` helpers and the `Migrate` composer implement the catch -> migrate -> retry loop. A one-call `migrateIfNeeded` RPC helper is designed but not built.
- Account history usually cannot be pruned safely because a program cannot enumerate its accounts; retiring account history needs an external completeness proof.
