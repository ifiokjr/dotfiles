# CLI and Code Generation

## Discover commands from help

The installed CLI is authoritative:

```sh
pina --help
pina build --help
pina generate --help
pina cpi --help
pina idl --help
pina idl generate --help
pina idl fetch --help
pina idl diff --help
pina idl publish --help
pina docs --help
pina init --help
pina lint --help
pina locks --help
pina map --help
pina test --help
pina dev --help
pina keys --help
pina doctor --help
pina explain --help
pina completions --help
pina profile --help
pina deploy --help
pina migrations --help
pina generate --help
```

Use `pina docs` to list bundled terminal topics. Custom topics can be supplied through `PINA_TEMPLATES_DIR` when a project maintains its own operational guidance.

## Daily project workflow

Run project-aware commands from the program directory or any descendant. Pina uses the nearest ancestor `pina.toml`; an existing unambiguous Cargo package also works without configuration. `pina idl` is the exception: it reads the crate at `--path` (default `.`) without discovery, so run it from the crate root or pass `--path`.

```sh
pina lint
pina build
pina test --unit
pina test
pina generate
```

`pina build` compiles SBF with the required `bpf-entrypoint` feature and refreshes the IDL. Pass program features explicitly when required:

```sh
pina build --features logs --no-default-features
```

Run `pina lint` before review to execute the official Pina security lint set associated with the installed CLI release. Use `pina lint --fix` only when source edits are authorized, then inspect and test every change. The bundled driver statically links the whole lint catalog, so additional project-defined lint libraries are never loaded.

The library target name determines the canonical outputs:

```text
<cargo-target>/deploy/<library-name>.so
<cargo-target>/idl/<library-name>.json
```

`pina generate` refreshes that IDL and renders the client languages selected in `pina.toml` under `[clients] languages`. Override the selection for one run with repeatable `--client cpi`, `--client rust`, `--client typescript`, `--client dart`, `--client cli-rust`, `--client cli-ts`, or `--client cli-dart` flags. Dart is also the Flutter target. CPI output is a separate `no_std` crate with `.invoke()` and `.invoke_signed()` builders. Each CLI application is generated on top of its base client (`cli-rust` requires `rust`, `cli-ts` requires `typescript`, `cli-dart` requires `dart`).

Generation defaults to `mode = "auto"`: it initializes an empty target, then updates only renderer-owned source directories on later runs. Existing manifests and crate/package entrypoints are preserved. Use `mode = "create"` or `mode = "update"` to enforce the expected state, `mode = "overwrite"` for an explicit complete cleanup, and `scaffold = false` for source-only output. These settings may be global under `[clients]` or overridden under `[clients.cpi]`, `[clients.rust]`, `[clients.typescript]`, and `[clients.dart]`. The CLI equivalents are `--mode` and `--no-scaffold`.

Generate the same crate from an external Codama or Anchor IDL with `pina cpi --idl <FILE> --output <DIR>`. Codama IDLs stay native; raw Anchor IDLs are normalized through `@codama/nodes-from-anchor` first.

TypeScript, Dart, `cli-ts`, and `cli-dart` generation runs the version-pinned Codama renderers through `npx` (falling back to `pnpm dlx`), so a project needs no local `node_modules`, but the first run needs registry access. Rust, CPI, and `cli-rust` crates inherit their dependencies from an enclosing workspace's `[workspace.dependencies]` when one declares `pina`. Otherwise, a freshly scaffolded client manifest names concrete, tested version requirements and declares its own empty `[workspace]`, so it builds on its own. An existing client manifest is yours and is never rewritten.

The IDL follows the migration policy recorded in `migrations/manifest.json`, the same one the macros expand against, so the program and its clients agree on every envelope. Without a manifest there is no policy, so nothing carries a version byte; record the baseline with `pina migrations create --auto true` before generating clients you intend to keep, because adding the policy later changes their wire format.

## Compute unit budgets

Priority fees are charged per requested compute unit, so clients should request a limit close to what the transaction uses. Record what each instruction costs, then regenerate:

```sh
pina test --record-compute-units
pina generate
```

`pina test --record-compute-units` runs the complete Surfpool suite (it conflicts with `--unit` and `--filter`) and writes `compute-units.json` beside the program's `Cargo.toml`: the most compute units each instruction consumed in a successful simulation, keyed by IDL name, plus the SHA-256 of the measured build. Failed transactions never count. An instruction no successful test sent is left out and named in a warning; send it through `ProgramTest::send`, `send_instruction`, `send_with_signers`, or `send_transaction` in a passing test to measure it. Commit the file with the clients it produced.

IDL generation attaches each measurement as a `pinaComputeUnits` plugin with `{ "measured": n, "limit": m }`, where `limit = round_up_to_100(measured × (100 + margin_percent) / 100) + 300`. `[compute_units] margin_percent` in `pina.toml` defaults to `20`; the 300 units cover `SetComputeUnitLimit` and `SetComputeUnitPrice` (150 each). Generators copy the limit and never recompute it:

- Rust: `<NAME>_MEASURED_COMPUTE_UNITS`, `<NAME>_COMPUTE_UNIT_LIMIT`, and `set_compute_unit_limit_instruction(units)`.
- TypeScript and Dart: the same constants and `get<Program>ComputeUnitLimit(instructions)`, which sums the program's instructions and returns no limit when one is unmeasured. Pass the result to `setTransactionMessageComputeUnitLimit`. The sum is conservative and ignores other programs' instructions.
- CLIs: every command requests its instruction's limit; `--compute-unit-limit <UNITS>` overrides it and `--simulate` prints consumption against the limit requested.

Re-record after changing the program. `pina generate` warns when `target/deploy/<library-name>.so` differs from the recorded build, and fails when `compute-units.json` names an instruction the program no longer declares; re-record or delete the stale entry. `pina build`, `pina idl`, and `pina test` warn about stale entries and ignore them, and the recording run never reads the file it replaces.

## Project diagnostics and identity

Use the versioned diagnostic report before changing a project:

```sh
pina doctor --json
pina keys show --json
```

`doctor --json` keeps stdout valid JSON and returns a failing exit status when required project or SBF prerequisites are unavailable. Its tool requirements follow the clients selected in `pina.toml`.

When a transaction fails with a bare code such as `InvalidAccountData`, ask Pina which check produced it instead of guessing:

```sh
pina explain <SIGNATURE> --json
pina explain --transaction-file ./failed.json --json
```

The report names the failing instruction, decodes the error (built-in, `PinaProgramError`, or the program's `#[error]` variant), and ranks candidate field rules with their `path:line`. Trust a candidate by its `confidence`: `confirmed` is proven by the transaction's flags, account counts, or keys; `checked_against_current_state` reads state that may have changed after the transaction; `possible` needs runtime values such as PDA seeds or argument values. The default network is localnet, so pass `--network` or `--rpc-url` for other clusters. A transaction rejected by preflight never lands and cannot be explained by signature; use the logs from simulation, or send with preflight disabled on a test validator.

Treat program identity changes as security-sensitive. `pina keys sync` validates an existing Ed25519 keypair and updates exactly one parsed `declare_id!`. `pina keys new` creates a local identity; only `pina keys new --force` may rotate an existing one. Never copy or print keypair bytes. On platforms where Pina cannot guarantee private permissions, generate the keypair with trusted platform tooling and then run `pina keys sync --keypair <path>`.

## Write-lock contention

Check which instructions can never run in parallel before a state layout hardens:

```sh
pina locks
pina locks --json
pina locks --deny-hotspots
```

A writable PDA whose seeds are all constants has one address, so every instruction that writes it serializes all of its traffic across the cluster. `pina locks` lists these hotspots with their derived addresses, writers, and readers, then an instruction conflict matrix (`●` always, `◐` may, `·` none). Fix a hotspot by sharding the PDA with a variable seed, moving hot fields into per-user accounts, or declaring accounts an instruction only reads as read-only. Accept an intentional singleton, such as an admin configuration, by listing its name in `[locks] allow` in `pina.toml`; an entry that names no hotspot fails the command. `--deny-hotspots` exits with status 1 on any hotspot that is not allowed.

`pina map` renders the same analysis as one self-contained HTML page (default `<target>/pina/map.html`; stdout is only the path, so `open "$(pina map)"` works) for a human to explore: a lock chart of instructions against accounts, hotspot plates, conflict tracing, and per-instruction and per-account detail. Agents should read `pina map --json` or `pina locks --json` rather than the HTML.

## Deterministic build artifacts

Use the verified-build backend when you need a deterministic SBF artifact:

```sh
pina build --verify
```

This requires an exact `solana-verify 0.5.1` installation, a working Docker-compatible daemon, a root `Cargo.lock`, the generated Solana CLI workspace metadata, and a completely clean Git worktree. Pina does not install or update these prerequisites.

The successful command prints the canonical `target/deploy` artifact, the generated IDL, a content-addressed SBF artifact, and its Pina-local build-record path. Keep the printed record and adjacent SBF together; consumers recompute the executable hash before trusting the record.

`pina build --verify` creates deterministic build inputs and outputs. It does not compare the artifact with an on-chain program or record an on-chain verification result.

## Testing and development

Use `pina test --unit` for native/Mollusk tests and `pina test` for the generated SBF/Surfpool integration package under `tests/surfpool`. Cargo remains attached to the terminal in both modes. `pina dev` delegates persistent artifact watching and redeployment to Surfpool, which owns terminal input, output, errors, prompts, and Ctrl-C until it exits. Its default is offline, so select `--network` or `--rpc-url` only when remote state is required. Prefer a named network. Explicit RPC URLs must be credential-free HTTP(S) URLs with a host and no user information, query, fragment, or control character. They are visible in Surfpool's child-process arguments, so never put a secret anywhere in the host, path, or other URL text. On the first run, use `pina dev --yes`, then inspect and commit the `txtx.yml` runbook Surfpool creates.

## IDL extraction

Generate a Codama root-node document from a program crate. Bare invocation remains compatible; `generate` makes the operation explicit:

```sh
pina idl --path ./programs/counter_program --output ./idls/counter_program.json
pina idl generate --path ./programs/counter_program --output ./idls/counter_program.json
```

Without `--output`, JSON is the only stdout content; progress and extraction counts go to stderr. This makes the command safe in pipelines:

```sh
pina idl --path ./programs/counter_program --compact | jq -e '.program'
```

Treat the IDL as a public contract. Review instruction, account, PDA, error, and type changes rather than accepting generated churn wholesale.

## Canonical on-chain IDLs

Network IDL operations always require an explicit cluster. Fetch the canonical direct, zlib-compressed UTF-8 Codama IDL under the fixed `idl` seed:

```sh
pina idl fetch --cluster devnet --program-id <PROGRAM_ADDRESS> --output ./idl.json
pina idl diff --cluster devnet --program-id <PROGRAM_ADDRESS> --file ./idl.json
```

`diff` compares parsed JSON: object order and whitespace are ignored, but array order is preserved. Exit status `0` means equal, `2` means different, and `1` means the command failed.

Direct publication requires the canonical upgrade-authority keypair and explicit confirmation (`--yes` in automation):

```sh
pina idl publish --cluster devnet --file ./idl.json \
  --authority ~/.config/solana/upgrade-authority.json --yes
```

For review, multisig, or DAO signing, export every transaction the official planner requires without submitting any:

```sh
pina idl publish --cluster mainnet-beta --file ./idl.json \
  --export <MULTISIG_ADDRESS> --output ./idl-plan.txt
```

Do not describe an export as one transaction. Preserve the complete upstream `[Transaction #N]` framing and order. An exported authority is a noop signer; do not combine `--export <ADDRESS>` with local authority or payer keypairs.

## Repository-wide client generation

`pina generate` generates the clients for one project, discovered through its `pina.toml`. To generate a whole repository, run it once per project:

```sh
for project in ./programs/*/; do
  pina generate --project "$project"
done
```

Output locations come from each project's `[clients]` table, so a repository controls per-language roots in configuration rather than on the command line. Generated roots may be replaced; never store hand-written code inside them.

Pina's generated clients preserve discriminator-first layouts and PinaPod boundary checks. Compact client codecs enforce declared capacity at both encode and decode boundaries. If a repository uses a custom renderer command, keep that command as the source of truth.

## Migration-aware generated clients

Generated code reads the checked-in `migrations/manifest.json`, so run `pina migrations create` before regenerating clients and never hand-edit a generated file. For every opted-in contract the Rust, TypeScript, and Dart clients emit:

- `<Account>MIGRATION_VERSION` (Dart `stateMigrationVersion`) — the schema version this client was generated from. Encoders stamp it into the envelope automatically; callers never pass a version. Decoders enforce it and reject other versions with a stale/future distinction: `getPinaPodMigrationVersionDecoder` in TypeScript, `StateVersionError::{Stale, Future}` in Rust, and the generated Dart equivalent. A stale split tells the caller to migrate the account on chain and retry; a future split tells the caller to upgrade the client.
- `<account>NeedsMigration(bytes)` (Rust `state_needs_migration`) — a cheap envelope check that returns true only when the bytes name this account's discriminator and carry a version older than the client's schema. Foreign discriminators and future versions return false; the decoder explains those when the account is decoded.
- `Migrate` — the reserved framework instruction composer (TypeScript and Dart `getMigrateInstruction`, Rust `Migrate::new().instruction()`). Slots 0 and 1 are always sent: the payer (the program-address placeholder when omitted) and the system program, which defaults to `11111111111111111111111111111111` because the program rejects anything else there. Every migratable slot is optional: omitted slots become program-address placeholders and trailing omitted migratable slots are dropped, so a client sends only the accounts that need migrating. Intended flow: check `needsMigration`, send `Migrate`, then retry the original instruction.
- Event log decoders — `parse<Program>EventsFromLogs(logs, programAddress?)` plus per-event `parse<Event>FromLog` and `decode<Event>` (for example `decodeValueChangedEventEvent` and `decodeValueChangedEventV0Event`, the names the Dart clients use too). Pass the complete, ordered log messages of one transaction to the program-level parser: it follows the runtime's `Program <address> invoke [n]` and `success`/`failed` frames and decodes a data line only while this program (or the `programAddress` you pass for another deployment) is the innermost invoked program. Any program can write a `Program data:` line with your discriminator, including one your program invokes through CPI, so the per-event `parse<Event>FromLog` helpers, which cannot attribute a line, are only for bytes already known to come from your program. A `Log truncated` transaction loses frames, so treat its events as incomplete. A versioned event is decoded, never converted: each earlier version is its own generated event, `<Event>V<n>` (for example `valueChangedEventV0`), with that version's codec, and the program-level parser routes every record by discriminator and version. A version no generated event describes throws (`event "valueChangedEvent" log carries migration version N, which this client cannot decode; regenerate it`) instead of being misread. Decoded records carry only their version's fields — no `sourceVersion`, no `wasMigrated`, no zero-filled fields. The Rust event module has no program-level parser: each version's `try_from_bytes` separates a stale record from a future one and names the event generated for the other version.

The one-call `migrateIfNeeded` RPC helper is designed in ADR 0008 but not generated; compose the check, `Migrate`, and retry explicitly.

## Using generated clients safely

Generated decoders parse bytes; they do not establish where those bytes came from. When an agent writes code on top of a client, it has to add the checks the client cannot make:

- **Check the owner before trusting decoded account data.** TypeScript, Dart, and Rust account decoders and CPI-crate `parse`/`matches` helpers check the discriminator (and the version envelope) only. An attacker-owned account can carry the same leading bytes. Off chain, compare the fetched account's owner with the program address before using the decoded state, or fetch a PDA through `fetch<Account>FromSeeds`, which derives the address. On chain, `assert_owner(&callee::ID)` the `AccountView` before parsing another program's state with its CPI crate.
- **Do not treat client decoding as validation.** On-chain `try_from_bytes` requires an exact length; TypeScript decoders accept trailing bytes, and no client enforces the program's `#[pina(validate(...))]` rules on event or account values. Validate values that matter where they are consumed.
- **Trust the IDL's writable flags only as far as the program declares them.** The IDL marks an account writable when its field is `&mut`, when the program calls `assert_writable` or declares `#[pina(validate(writable))]`, or when it is the payer, `from`, or `to` of a Pina account-creation, allocation, or transfer builder. Any other path that moves an account's lamports must still declare writability explicitly. Otherwise every client sends the account read-only, and the transaction fails with a privilege escalation whenever that account is not also the fee payer, and always through CPI.
- **Read CPI size constants carefully.** A CPI crate drops IDL fields its renderer cannot express, so compare `LEN`/`MAX_LEN` with the program's own `SIZE` before sizing an allocation from them.

## Static SBF profiling

Profile a compiled shared object:

```sh
pina profile
pina profile ./target/deploy/counter_program.so
pina profile ./target/deploy/counter_program.so --json --output ./profile.json
```

When the path is omitted, Pina discovers `<cargo-target>/deploy/<library-name>.so`. The report is a static estimate, not a validator execution trace. Use it for deterministic comparisons and investigate material changes in context. Output files are written atomically and cannot alias the input binary through hardlinks or linked paths.

## Trace-driven CU profiling

To find where an instruction's compute units actually go, trace the project's Mollusk tests:

```sh
pina profile trace
pina profile trace --filter increment --instruction increment
pina profile trace --json > trace.json
pina profile trace --folded > stacks.folded
```

The program's `mollusk-svm` dev-dependency must enable `features = ["register-tracing"]`; when no trace is recorded, the error prints the exact line to add. Tests must load the program by name so `SBF_OUT_DIR` can point at the traced build. Every executed SBF instruction costs 1 CU; syscalls are listed by name and call site but their runtime charges are not included. Read the hottest lines and inclusive function costs before changing code, and treat a "debug information changed code generation" warning as a sign that counts are approximate for the deployed build. `--trace-dir <target>/pina/trace/traces` re-analyzes the last run without rebuilding.

# Verified deployments

Use the content-addressed record produced by the deterministic build. Never invent or override its repository, revision, paths, library, or Cargo feature set.

```bash
pina build --verify
pina verify check --program-id <ADDRESS> --cluster devnet
pina verify record \
  --program-id <ADDRESS> \
  --cluster devnet \
  --build-record ./target/pina/verifiable/my_program-<HASH>.json \
  --authority ./upgrade-authority.json
```

`pina verify check` is read-only: it compares the local artifact with the deployed executable and returns exit code `2` for a completed hash mismatch. Do not retry that result as an infrastructure failure.

`pina verify record` rebuilds the exact repository revision from the validated build record and writes verification metadata on-chain. Review the program, cluster, record, and authority before adding `--yes`; mainnet and unknown remote RPC origins additionally require `--acknowledge-mainnet`.

Use `pina verify record --export [AUTHORITY] --output verification.tx` when another signer or multisig must submit the transaction. Export performs Pina's deployed-hash preflight but never submits or rebuilds the repository, does not require `--yes` or `--acknowledge-mainnet`, and writes only the validated base58 or base64 transaction payload. Remote verification begins only after the exported transaction is submitted.

`pina verify submit --program-id <ADDRESS> --uploader <ADDRESS>` submits an existing record to the official mainnet remote verifier. `pina verify status --program-id <ADDRESS>` is the corresponding read-only mainnet status query. Never place credentials in an RPC URL; the URL is necessarily visible in child-process arguments.

## Rehearse an upgrade

Before upgrading a deployed program, replay its recent traffic against the candidate:

```sh
pina rehearse --network devnet --build
pina rehearse --network mainnet --limit 100 --json > rehearsal.json
pina rehearse --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8899 --signature <SIGNATURE>
```

Pina fetches the program's recent transactions read-only, forks the same endpoint with Surfpool, and profiles every signed transaction against the deployed program and then the candidate on one frozen snapshot. Statuses are `unchanged`, `cu_changed` (informational), `state_changed`, `outcome_changed`, and `skipped`. A transaction that fails identically in both runs is skipped as `failed_in_both`: its state moved on and it says nothing about the upgrade. Different errors in both runs are an outcome change, because error codes are part of the program's contract.

Exit code `2` means behaviour changed: inspect each `state_changed` account diff (fields are decoded from the IR) and each `outcome_changed` log excerpt before deploying. Use `--allow-changes` only for reviewed, intended changes. Exit code `3` means no transaction could be compared, so the upgrade is unverified: rehearse more or newer traffic rather than treating it as a pass. Exit code `1` is an operational failure, including any failed RPC request, a program that is not deployed, and a candidate the runtime refuses to load, which an upgrade would also reject. Requests are never retried, so do not loop the command against a rate-limited endpoint.

To gate the deployment itself, add `--rehearse` to `pina deploy` instead of running the two commands separately. It rehearses the exact artifact the plan pins (checked against the plan's SHA-256), against the cluster the deployment targets, after the plan prints and before the confirmation prompt. Exit code `2` (behaviour changed) and `3` (nothing compared, or the program is not deployed yet) stop the deployment before anything is sent; `1` is an operational failure. `--allow-rehearsal-changes` accepts reviewed changes but never a rehearsal that compared nothing, and `--rehearse-limit <N>` sets how many recent transactions replay (default 25). With `--dry-run --json`, the plan gains a `rehearsal` key holding the `pina rehearse --json` report. Deploy a program's first version without `--rehearse`: there is nothing deployed to rehearse against.

## Safe deployment

Plan deployments before permitting a write:

```sh
pina deploy --cluster devnet \
  --upgrade-authority ./keys/devnet-authority.json \
  --payer ./keys/devnet-payer.json \
  --dry-run --json
```

The cluster is always explicit. Pina never inherits a Solana CLI target or wallet, and deploy never creates a program identity. Conventional artifacts are `<cargo-target>/deploy/<library-name>.so` and `<cargo-target>/deploy/<library-name>-keypair.json`; override either path only when the plan requires it. Review the program ID and complete argument vector in the plan. Keep keypairs below 4 KiB and owner-private; on Unix use mode `0600`, while Windows ACLs must be restricted with operating-system tooling.

The plan prints the paths you passed, but the deploy program receives private owner-only copies (`<tmp>/pina-deploy-*/payer.json` and so on) that Pina re-verifies against the plan before running it. `--remote-command` replaces `solana program deploy` with `sh -c <command>` and passes those copies through `PINA_DEPLOY_*` environment variables, never on the command line.

Remote execution requires an interactive `deploy` confirmation or `--yes`. Named mainnet and custom remote endpoints also require `--allow-mainnet`. A loopback URL (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) skips confirmation and records no publication receipt. Pina cannot tell a local validator from an SSH tunnel or proxy to a live cluster on a loopback port, so never deploy to a forwarded remote cluster through a loopback URL; use its real URL instead. Non-loopback deploys record a publication receipt that freezes the deployed migration versions; `--record-publication` opts a loopback deploy into the same lifecycle. Custom URL user information, queries, and fragments are rejected, but accepted hosts and paths remain visible in plan output and process listings. Never put a secret anywhere in the URL; prefer a named cluster. Use `--build` when the canonical artifact must be refreshed before the final plan. Deployment requires the external Agave `solana` executable on `PATH`.
