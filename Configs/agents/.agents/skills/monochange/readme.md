# @monochange/skill

Agent guidance for using monochange as a CLI-driven release-planning harness.

The package is intentionally task-oriented: start with the short [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) at runtime, then open the focused files under [skills/](./skills/readme.md) only when a task needs more context. The [examples](./examples/readme.md) are small enough to copy into a new repository and then tailor to its package graph.

monochange discovers packages in a monorepo, reads release intent from `.changeset/*.md`, computes package and group versions, updates versioned files, creates release records, and can drive provider/package publishing workflows configured in `monochange.toml`.

## Start here

- [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md): short runtime instructions for agents.
- [skills/readme.md](./skills/readme.md): index of focused modules and when to open each one.
- [skills/commands.md](./skills/commands.md): verified built-in commands, step commands, and step types.
- [skills/configuration.md](./skills/configuration.md): authoring `monochange.toml` with copyable examples.
- [skills/changesets.md](./skills/changesets.md): creating and maintaining `.changeset/*.md` files.
- [skills/change-classification.md](./skills/change-classification.md): deciding major, minor, patch, or none from release-aware evidence.
- [skills/reference.md](./skills/reference.md): complete reference for day-to-day operation.
- [skills/linting.md](./skills/linting.md): `monochange check`, lint presets, rule severity, and manifest policy.
- [skills/multi-package-publishing.md](./skills/multi-package-publishing.md): readiness, bootstrap, and package publishing flows.
- [skills/trusted-publishing.md](./skills/trusted-publishing.md): OIDC/trusted-publishing notes for package registries.
- [examples/readme.md](./examples/readme.md): scenario examples.

### Repository Lints

monochange includes opt-in repository URL lint rules for Cargo, Dart, and npm-family manifests:

```toml
[lints.rules]
"cargo/manifest-repository" = "error"
"dart/manifest-repository" = "error"
"npm/manifest-repository" = "error"
```

These rules compare each manifest's `repository` field with the repository configured under `[source]` in `monochange.toml`. Root-level packages use the base repository URL, while packages in subdirectories use `{repo_url}/tree/{default_branch}/{relative_package_dir}`. Run `monochange check --fix` to insert or update repository fields; there is no per-rule `fix` option.

Cargo also resolves `repository = { workspace = true }` by reading the root manifest's `[workspace.package].repository` (falling back to root `[package].repository`). If you intentionally want to allow workspace inheritance without validating the package-specific URL, configure:

```toml
[lints.rules]
"cargo/manifest-repository" = { level = "error", allow_workspace_inheritance = true }
```

For full rule-by-rule behavior, see the manifest linting reference and `monochange lint explain <rule-id>`.

## Important distinction

The CLI has three command classes:

1. **Binary commands** wired by the binary, such as `monochange init`, `monochange check`, and `monochange mcp`; typed operations such as validation and publish readiness are exposed as `monochange step *` commands.
2. **Step commands** generated from built-in step variants, such as `monochange step discover` and `monochange step prepare-release`.
3. **User-defined workflow commands** created by `[cli.<name>]` in `monochange.toml`, such as `monochange run release` or `monochange run publish` in repositories that define them.

Always inspect `monochange help` or `monochange.toml` before assuming a user-defined workflow command exists. A repository can expose friendly commands such as `monochange run release`, `monochange run change`, or `monochange run publish`, but those names are configuration, not CLI guarantees. The step commands remain the portable fallback.
