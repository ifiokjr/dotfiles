# monochange

Use this skill when the user wants to operate monochange in a repository or author a `monochange.toml` configuration for versioned package releases.

monochange is a release-planning harness rather than a single fixed workflow. It discovers package manifests, maps them to configured package and group ids, reads `.changeset/*.md` release intent, computes versions, updates native manifests and extra versioned files, and then exposes release, source-provider, and package-publishing actions through built-in steps or repository-defined workflows.

Agents should optimize for safety and traceability: inspect config first, prefer JSON/dry-run output while planning, preserve changeset intent in files, and only run mutating release or publish flows after the user has approved the exact command path.

## Source-of-truth rules

- Read `monochange.toml` before recommending commands. Configured `[cli.<name>]` workflows run as `monochange run <name>` and vary per repository.
- Do not assume `discover`, `change`, `release`, `publish`, or similar configured workflow names exist in every repo. They are user-defined and should be invoked as `monochange run <name>` only when they appear in `monochange help` for that workspace.
- Binary commands are wired by the CLI. Step commands are always exposed as `monochange step <step-name>` for built-in step variants, except the generic `Command` step.
- When authoring `[cli.*]` workflows, command inputs are explicit per step. Add `inputs = ["name"]` on a step to inherit a command input unchanged, or use the map form for overrides and renamed values.
- Prefer package or group ids from `monochange.toml` over manifest names.
- Internal dependency constraint prefixes come from the strategy in `monochange versions sync --strategy exact|caret|compatible` (never `~` or `=` there). To write custom prefixes at release time, set `prefix` on a typed `versioned_files` entry, or `[ecosystems.<name>] dependency_version_prefix` for the ecosystem default; see [skills/configuration.md](skills/configuration.md).
- Use dry-run or preview commands before mutating versions, committing, tagging, releasing, or publishing.
- A package that ships a CLI can register it under `[package.<id>].cli = { name, snapshot }` so change classification reports command-surface breaks instead of unclassified changes; refresh baselines with `monochange snapshot --package <id> --save` during release preparation.
- Gate CI on a dry-run publish check (`monochange step publish-packages --dry-run`), ideally also against a simulated release commit (`monochange run release --commit` without pushing), so changes that would break publication never merge; see [skills/multi-package-publishing.md](skills/multi-package-publishing.md).
- Never publish with local credentials on behalf of a user unless they explicitly own that operation and the project rules allow it.
- Gitignore only `.monochange/local/`. Never ignore the whole `.monochange/` directory: release records (`.monochange/releases/<id>/release.json`) and prerelease state are committed release state that publish, tag, and readiness steps read from git history, so ignoring them makes releases unpublishable.

## Fast workflow

1. Inspect configuration: `monochange step validate`, `monochange step config`, or `monochange help`. Use this to learn package ids, enabled ecosystems, groups, and which top-level workflow commands actually exist.
2. Inspect packages: use the configured workflow command (often `monochange run discover --format json`) or the immutable `monochange step discover --format json`. Prefer JSON when another tool or agent will consume the package graph.
3. Classify change severity before writing release intent: run `monochange change classify --detection-level semantic --format json --dependency-propagation public` or call `monochange_classify_changes` with `detection_level: "semantic"`. Read [skills/change-classification.md](skills/change-classification.md), then account for every affected package, finding, coverage boundary, pending changeset action, and registered CLI surface (`cli` block) finding.
4. Create release intent: use a configured workflow command (often `monochange run change ...`) or write `.changeset/*.md` manually. Read existing changesets first so you can update or merge related intent instead of creating duplicates.
5. Preview versioned files: use the configured workflow command (often `monochange run release --dry-run --format json` or `--diff`) or `monochange step prepare-release --dry-run`. The preview is where you verify versions, changelog entries, generated manifests, lockfile work, and semantic SemVer `compatibilityEvidence` before mutating the tree.
6. Extract a named release-note artifact when it needs separate review or delivery: `monochange notes --output <id> [--target <id>]`. It prints to stdout by default; use `--file <path>` for a CI artifact. This is read-only and does not prepare a release.
7. Run validation and linting: `monochange check`, `monochange step validate`, and `monochange changeset validate --api`. API validation enforces only high-confidence evidence by default; use `--strict` only after the repository has calibrated partial analyzers.
8. Only after review, run configured commit/release/publish workflows. Keep release-record, readiness, bootstrap, plan, and publish artifacts when the workflow emits them.

## Verified command inventory

The command inventory in this skill is based on `crates/monochange/src/cli.rs`, `crates/monochange_core/src/lib.rs`, and the CLI help snapshot `crates/monochange/tests/snapshots/cli_help__help_overview_lists_all_commands@help_overview_lists_all_commands.snap`.

Built-in commands in the current CLI:

- `monochange init`: create a starter `monochange.toml` from discovered manifests.
- `monochange populate`: add missing configurable workflow definitions to an existing config.
- `monochange skill`: install or update the monochange skill bundle.
- `monochange subagents`: generate repository-local agent/subagent guidance for monochange work.
- `monochange analyze`: inspect semantic changes for a package.
- `monochange notes --output <id>`: render one configured release-note output to stdout or an explicit file without modifying release state.
- `monochange change classify --detection-level semantic --format json --dependency-propagation public`: compare the pull request and latest release, run the richest available ecosystem analysis, report finding evidence, and propose package bumps.
- `monochange api diff --base origin/main --format json`: inspect API diff classification as structured data.
- `monochange changeset validate --api --format markdown`: validate pending changesets against high-confidence classification evidence; add `--strict` to enforce advisory proposals.
- `monochange step tag-release`: create release tags from an embedded release record.
- `monochange step release-record`: inspect the release record reachable from a tag or commit.
- `monochange check`: validate configuration, changesets, and manifest lint rules.
- `monochange lint`: list or explain lint rules and presets.
- `monochange mcp`: run the stdio MCP server.
- `monochange step validate`: validate `monochange.toml` and changeset targets.
- `monochange step publish-readiness`: verify publishability from a release record without publishing.
- `monochange step placeholder-publish`: publish first-time placeholder versions for packages in a release record.
- `monochange versions`: synchronize internal workspace dependency constraints across all supported ecosystems; `--strategy exact|caret|compatible` controls the written constraint prefix.

Built-in step commands:

- `monochange step config`
- `monochange step validate`
- `monochange step discover`
- `monochange step display-versions`
- `monochange step create-change-file`
- `monochange step prepare-release`
- `monochange step commit-release`
- `monochange step verify-release-branch`
- `monochange step publish-release`
- `monochange step placeholder-publish`
- `monochange step publish-packages`
- `monochange step plan-publish-rate-limits`
- `monochange step open-release-request`
- `monochange step comment-released-issues`
- `monochange step affected-packages`
- `monochange step diagnose-changesets`
- `monochange step retarget-release`

`Command` is a valid `[cli.*].steps[].type` for running shell commands, but it is not exposed as `monochange step command`.

## MCP tools

The `monochange mcp` server exposes these tools:

- `monochange_validate`: validate config and changeset targets.
- `monochange_discover`: return structured packages, groups, dependencies, and ecosystems.
- `monochange_diagnostics`: inspect pending changesets with git and review context.
- `monochange_change`: create a changeset through structured tool input.
- `monochange_release_preview`: run a dry-run release preview.
- `monochange_release_manifest`: produce a release manifest payload for downstream automation.
- `monochange_affected_packages`: evaluate changed paths and changeset coverage.
- `monochange_lint_catalog`: list lint rules and presets.
- `monochange_lint_explain`: explain one lint rule or preset.
- `monochange_analyze_changes`: inspect semantic diffs for package-aware changes.
- `monochange_classify_changes`: compare the pull request and latest release, then return evidence-backed package bumps.
- `monochange_validate_changeset`: check one changeset against the current semantic diff.

Prefer MCP tools when the caller needs structured data and the shell when you need to run the exact repository workflow that maintainers use locally or in CI.

## Semantic SemVer guardrails

Release planning treats built-in semantic analysis as advisory evidence. `monochange change classify` reports the current pull request separately from the full interval since the package's latest release. Compare this evidence with human-authored changesets:

- removed or incompatibly modified public API/export evidence implies at least `major`;
- a removed `monochange/package-lifecycle` package implies at least `major` with high-confidence evidence;
- added public API/export evidence implies at least `minor`;
- dependency or metadata evidence is usually `patch` context;
- warnings about semantic changes without matching changesets should be resolved before release.

Package lifecycle findings are complete and high-confidence. TypeScript declaration findings can also be complete and high-confidence when semantic mode resolves the workspace compiler, config, dependencies, and explicit typed entrypoints. Cargo findings can be complete for the configured cargo-semver-checks feature/target matrix. Syntax fallbacks and unchecked runtime behavior remain partial. Follow [skills/change-classification.md](skills/change-classification.md) to inspect engine versions, every `coverage.checks` cell, and all coverage gaps before choosing release intent.

For comparing two refs, use `monochange analyze`:

```nu
monochange analyze --package core --main-ref <base-ref> --head-ref <head-ref>
```

For release-aware trajectory:

```nu
monochange analyze --package core --release-ref <last-release-tag> --main-ref main --head-ref HEAD --format json
```
